# Harmonalyzer
This is a music visualizer and "harmony analyzer" designed to be run on an RPi pico connected to a microphone and to a MAX2719 driving a 32Ã—8 LED matrix.

There is also a button, and pressing the button toggles forward between modes, including pitch intensity display, oscilloscope, chord guesser, and guitar tuner.
